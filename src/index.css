/* its give you an error says  Gradient has outdated direction syntax. New syntax is like `to left` instead of `right`

then save it, then it works right? after that lets fix our font. first google it and search for sega logo font css 

dont worry its free then click the first link or instead of doing that i can paste here the link 

https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/sega-logo-font then after that click Download @font-face Kit then after that extract it 

then you'll see that has a .woff which is actually a font file extension that stands for (Web Open Font Format)

The Web Open Font Format (WOFF) is a font format for use in web pages. WOFF files are OpenType or TrueType fonts, 

with format-specific compression applied and additional XML metadata added.

and style.css. So it actually tells you what you can include. and after you open that style.css file inside the folder of

sega-logo-font-cufonfonts-webfont, you need to copy all of that syntax and paste it to the header one which is in the App.js

using App.css which I think you've deleted that already so lets bring back by creating new file named it App.css like this:

/* #### Generated By: http://www.cufonfonts.com #### */

/* @font-face {
  font-family: 'SEGA LOGO FONT';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: normal;
  src: local('SEGA LOGO FONT'), url('SEGA.woff') format('woff');
} 

and @font-face just tells us our font, and in order to use that well just say 'h1' has a 'font family of Sega Logo Font' like this

h1 {
  font-family: 'SEGA LOGO FONT'
}

now this don't actually do anything because well you need the font file in the folder of sega-logo-font-cufonfonts-webfont

which is the font file is SEGA.woff so they can find 'Sega Logo Font' and that's simply a matter of us dragging in our font file

in your project folder, well in my case is in the robo-friends folder then inside the src folder and you can simply access it by looking at the URL like this

url("SEGA.woff") then if our 'App.css' file has access to then save it well nothing will change, because in order for App.css file to work

you have to import it to the App.js and save it alright it's work, I don't know if you can see it but its there. so you want to make

it bigger and obviously the color black doesn't work well with this background so add this in the h1 on your App.css

font-weight: 200;
color: #0ccac4;

then save it and lastly using tachyons you can just make <h1> bigger in your App.js then 

you can just add classname from <h1> you can just do 'f1' wells its not the same, lets do 'f2', alright that's looks pretty good. 

Our app is looking nice and clean. there's still a few changes that you want to make in the sample project

but overall everything looks good. you've played around a bit with the App.css you've added a new font file 

which is inside the src folder named 'SEGA.woff' and you've changed a background of index.js file with the index.css file

go back to the App.js for the continuation of comment section
